#We want to find the best fitting polynomial of any order (that you choose)
#between a set of point in the XY plane.
#For this we employ a Method of Least Squares.
#The following function returns a list of coefficients for a polynomial of
#of order chosen by the user.
#Exanple of the return [a, b, c, d] where a is coefficient of the largest
#degree term (in this case 3).

#This will give you whatever order polynomial you want, babe.

    #We set up 3 list that later will be turned into numpy
    # A transposed
    # X values
    # Y values
    At = []
    X = []
    Y = []

    #From the list of coordinates we split Xs and Ys into their respective lists.
    #Do note that while X is just a list, Y is a list of lists
    #as we later want it to be a colmn vector.

    #to powers of descending order.
